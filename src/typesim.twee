:: typesim 
The {{{<<typesim>>}}} macro allows you to //simulate// user input, but actually show them a predefined message. Try typing in the box below for an example:

<<typesim "You get to feel like you're typing, and that can be a cool interaction, but in reality, we just show you what we want you to see and make you say what we want you to say.">>\
    Once the user finishes the message, you can run any code you like!\
<</typesim>>\
